# Exegol resources

This repository hosts various files that can be useful to Exegol users during pentest engagements, bug bounties, CTFs, and so on.
These resources are automatically downloaded, loaded and updated by the Exegol wrapper (entrypoint to the project) and can be shared (enabled by default) with Exegol containers.

More information on [docs.exegol.com](https://docs.exegol.com/).
